                        This line graph illustrates the maintenance frequency of machines over the years. The Y-axis denotes unique machine IDs, while the X-axis represents the corresponding years when maintenance activities occurred.

                        Each line on the graph represents a specific machine, showcasing how often maintenance has been conducted on each machine throughout the observed period. The upward peaks indicate years with more frequent maintenance, offering a visual representation of the overall maintenance patterns.

                        This visualization enables a quick assessment of which machines have undergone more or less maintenance over time, providing valuable insights into maintenance trends and allowing for strategic decision-making in optimizing machine performance and reliability.

                      This doughnut graph provides an insightful overview of emergency repair occurrences. The segments of the doughnut represent two categories: 'Emergency Repair' and 'Working' indicating whether a machine required emergency repairs. The size of each segment corresponds to the count of occurrences for each category.

                      A larger portion of the doughnut dedicated to 'Emergency Repair' signifies a higher number of instances where emergency repairs were necessary, while a larger 'Working' segment indicates a greater number of incidents where machines did not require urgent attention.

                      This visual representation is valuable for understanding the frequency of emergency repair situations, allowing for proactive measures to minimize such occurrences and enhance overall operational reliability.
